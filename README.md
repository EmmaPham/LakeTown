# Lake_Town
A personal project



It is said that Spirit Town used to be a beautiful town. Unfortunately, the Town was attacked by a Demon. People were panicking. To the rescue came 5 Wizards that visited the town, then they used their power to kill the demon. However, upon dying the demon unleashed a curse which made the 5 wizards ended up sealed into 5 different spirit pieces, and the town was in eternal night, never to witness morning. Only a hero dared lift the curse by collecting all of the wizards spirit orbs and setting them free with the spirit tree, near where the demon died.

You are a hero. Collect 5 spirit pieces, bring to the Spirit Tree to free the wizards and lift the curse of eternal darkness
